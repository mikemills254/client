### WORK FLOW

### Account Creation

- Users can create an account using their email, password, and username.
- Upon registration, the user's credentials are securely stored in the database.

### Authentication

- Before accessing the socket for message communication, users need to be authenticated.
- Authentication ensures that only registered users can participate in the messaging system.

### Socket.io Integration

- Socket.io facilitates real-time bidirectional communication between agents and clients.
- All agents are placed in a socket room called "agent," where they can receive messages from clients.

### Message Handling

- Clients can send messages to the "agent" room, where all agents can view and respond to them.
- To ensure efficient handling, when an agent accepts a message, it is removed from the dashboard and assigned to that agent.

### Inbox Management

- Agents can access all messages they have previously accepted via the inbox.
- The inbox provides a centralized location for agents to manage and respond to messages.

### Message Prioritization

- Messages marked as urgent are visually highlighted in red on the dashboard.
- This visual cue alerts agents to prioritize urgent messages for faster resolution.

### Quick resonding

- Client messages that rather generic, you can quick respond with a list of quick response messages
